# Classwork on creating Unit Tests in  Django

Using the sample HomePage tests as a pattern, add the following 5 unit tests:

```
    def test_about_page_status_code(self):
    
    def test_view_url_by_name(self):
    
    def test_view_uses_correct_template(self):
    
    def test_about_page_contains_correct_html(self):
    
    def test_about_page_does_not_contain_incorrect_html(self):
```

Execute the tests and confirm that they run successfully.
